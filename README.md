# Develop-an-AI-chatbot-for-FAQs
Overview
The project involves developing an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to internships, application processes, and organizational information. The chatbot aims to provide quick, relevant, and accurate responses to user inquiries, enhancing the user experience and streamlining the information retrieval process.

Key Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses. It employs string matching and similarity algorithms to find the best answers from a predefined FAQ dataset.

Predefined FAQ Knowledge Base: The chatbot is equipped with a comprehensive set of FAQs covering various topics, including:

Internship duration
Application procedures
Eligibility criteria
Payment status (paid/unpaid)
Required documents
Selection processes
Full-time position opportunities
Contact information for further inquiries
User Interaction: The chatbot features an interactive command-line interface where users can:

Ask questions related to internships.
Receive answers based on the FAQ knowledge base.
Use commands like "help" to get assistance, "list questions" to see available FAQs, and "quit" to exit the chat.
Greeting and Farewell Handling: The chatbot recognizes greetings and responds with friendly messages, creating a more engaging user experience. It also provides farewell messages when the user decides to exit.

Suggestions for Unmatched Queries: If the user's question does not match any FAQ closely, the chatbot suggests the top three similar questions, helping users rephrase their inquiries for better results.

Logging User Interactions: The chatbot logs all user queries and responses to a text file (user_log.txt) with timestamps. This feature allows for future analysis and improvements based on user interactions.

Extensibility: The chatbot can be easily extended with additional FAQs, improved matching algorithms, or integration with more advanced NLP libraries or frameworks.

Technical Implementation
Programming Language: Python 3
Libraries Used:
difflib for string matching and similarity checking.
Data Storage: FAQs are stored in a dictionary format within the script, making it easy to update and manage.
Usage
To run the chatbot:

Save the provided Python script as faq_chatbot.py.
Execute the script in a Python environment.
Interact with the chatbot through the command line by typing questions or commands.
Future Enhancements
Integrate machine learning models for better understanding and response generation.
Implement a web-based interface for broader accessibility.
Use cloud-based NLP services for enhanced capabilities.
Expand the knowledge base with more dynamic content and user-generated FAQs.
